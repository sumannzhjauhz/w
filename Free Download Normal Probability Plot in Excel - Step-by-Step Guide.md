## What is a Normal Probability Plot?

A **normal probability plot**, also known as a quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot, is a graphical technique used to assess whether or not a dataset is approximately normally distributed. In simple terms, it compares your data to a theoretical normal distribution. If the data points fall close to a straight line, it suggests your data is normally distributed. Why is this important? Many statistical tests and models assume normality, and knowing if your data meets this assumption is vital. Excel makes it easier than ever to generate these plots.

## Why Use Excel for Normal Probability Plots?

Excel is readily accessible and user-friendly, making it an excellent choice for creating these plots, especially for beginners. While specialized statistical software exists, Excel provides a convenient and efficient way to **quickly visualize and assess normality**. This course simplifies the process, teaching you:

*   **How to calculate expected normal values in Excel.**
*   **How to create the scatter plot.**
*   **How to add a trendline for easy interpretation.**
